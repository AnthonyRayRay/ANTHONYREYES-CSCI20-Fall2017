A computer will select a number between 1-50.
User will guess a number between 1-50 from the computer.
User will have 10 points (guesses) to choose the number the computer is thinking.
User will lose a point out of the ten for every incorrect guess.
The Computer will let user know after each guess if the number the computer is thinking is higher or lower.
Once user has chosen the correct number the computer will let user know.
From here the computer will let user know how many guesses it took out of the 10 points to tell user the correct number the computer was thinking.
The Computer will think of a new number and we'd repeat back from step one.
